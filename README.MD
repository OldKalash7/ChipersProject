# HACKING SECRET CIPHERS WITH PYTHON

This repository contains the ciphers proposed in the books of the title. The objective of this project is to
learn python and some basic cryptography concepts. Programs may not follow 100% the examples in the books

### DISCLAIMER

Just do not use this ciphers to encrypt any vital data of yours, use real tools instead.

### DEPENDENCIES

### CIPHERS IMPLEMENTED

1. Reverse Cipher (Planning on replacing the while loop with a for loop)
2. Caesar Cipher, with option for key.
